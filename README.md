># Diabetes Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project applies deep learning techniques to predict diabetes outcomes using the Diabetes dataset. It demonstrates how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be used to support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare, while also serving as a hands on journey to sharpen core data science and machine learning skills.

>## Purpose of the Project

    The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. **Healthcare Insight**: To explore how deep learning can assist in predicting disease based on medical key attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin levels and many more.
2. **Personal Skill Development**: To strengthen my capabilities in Python programming, ANN modeling, data preprocessing, and reproducible workflow design through practical experimentation.

>## Aim of the Project

- Build and train an ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras for binary classification.
- Apply feature scaling and validation splitting to improve model generalization.
- Implement callbacks like `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting and optimize training.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and plots.
